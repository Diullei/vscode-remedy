### Features

### BREAKING CHANGES

* The theme has been split into two distinct versions:

- Remedy - Straight Up: A non-italic variant
- Remedy - Tilted: An italic variant that is best used with the Operator Mono font

As a side-effect, the italic variant should now italicise more languages without adding custom overrides into this theme, which means better consistency. ðŸŽ¨
