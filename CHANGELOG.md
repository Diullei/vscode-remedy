### Features

* add styles for GitLens extension üòç ([cf8d1d9](https://github.com/robertrossmann/vscode-remedy/commit/cf8d1d9))
* add styles for LintLens extension ([997eb71](https://github.com/robertrossmann/vscode-remedy/commit/997eb71))

* use text colour for line & selection highlights ([c71beec](https://github.com/robertrossmann/vscode-remedy/commit/c71beec))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Orange is the new red. üòç

The reddish accents were great and all but the accents frequently clashed with diffs, errors and other things which are expected to be red by their very nature. Using a different accent we are free of those clashes. Don't worry, though, the orange still looks awesome! üé®
* Previously, the current line highlight and selection highlight used the accent (red) colour. While it seemed like a good idea in the beginning due to various consistency reasons, it turned out to be rather a bad choice - red is also used in the diff view and selecting anything in the diff view, or simply trying to find the line where the cursor is currently placed by colour was almost impossible as they blended completely with the diff.

Changing the highlights to a very light variant of the base text colour improves the overal experience quite significantly. üé®
