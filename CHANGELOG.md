# [2.0.0](https://github.com/robertrossmann/vscode-remedy/compare/1.2.0...2.0.0) (2019-09-20)


### Bug Fixes

* remove invalid template variable from github release action ([64500ae](https://github.com/robertrossmann/vscode-remedy/commit/64500ae))


### Features

* offer non-italic version of the theme ðŸ’ª ([93eecb3](https://github.com/robertrossmann/vscode-remedy/commit/93eecb3))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The theme has been split into two distinct versions:

- Remedy - Straight Up: A non-italic variant
- Remedy - Tilted: An italic variant that is best used with the Operator Mono font

As a side-effect, the italic variant should now italicise more languages without adding custom overrides into this theme, which means better consistency. ðŸŽ¨
