# Remedy - Terminal

> A MacOS Terminal profile matching the colours used in VS Code's Remedy theme. üé®

## Installation

Download the _Terminal.profile_ file from the [latest release assets][github-releases] on Github or from this directory and open it. It will get added to your Terminal's profiles from where you can make this profile the default one - all subsequent Terminal windows will then use this profile.

After the intallation you will likely want to fix/change the following settings:

- Font (I use _Operator Mono_ with ligatures hacked into it ü§∑‚Äç)
- Cursor
- Any other, non-colour-related settings

Enjoy!
