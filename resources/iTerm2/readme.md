## Installation

- Download the _Remedy.itermcolors_ file from the [latest release assets][github-releases] on Github or from this directory
- Launch iTerm 2

If you would like to make iTerm look like in the screenshot, you might want to customise the following settings:

- Font (I use _Operator Mono_ with ligatures hacked into it ü§∑‚Äç)
- Cursor (I'm using 'Box')
- Any other, non-colour-related settings

Enjoy!
