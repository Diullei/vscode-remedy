> A dark theme with reddish accents with roots in Base16 - Eighties colour theme

The theme features a reddish accent throughout the UI. Code colours are based in the Base16 -
Eighties colours. My goal is to provide a very consistent colour coding for various tokens, so that
they look identical not just for a single language but also across all languages (ie. strings, type
annotations, classes, language keywords etc. have the same colour regardless of the language you
use). I believe I achieved that goal. üòç
